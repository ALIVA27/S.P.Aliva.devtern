# The-Discovery-of-Handwashing-A-Python-Recreation

Overview
"The Discovery of Handwashing" is a historical study that showcased the importance of handwashing in preventing infections. This project aims to recreate and analyze the data from the original study using Python. By examining the historical data and implementing modern data analysis techniques, we aim to gain insights into the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates in hospitals.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data on childbirth and mortality rates at the Vienna General Hospital in the 19th century. It includes records before and after the introduction of handwashing by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis in 1847. The dataset is pre-processed and cleaned for analysis.

Objectives
- Recreate the analysis conducted by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis on the impact of handwashing.
- Visualize the trends in childbirth and mortality rates before and after the introduction of handwashing.
- Calculate and compare mortality rates before and after handwashing to quantify the effectiveness of the intervention.
- Explore additional factors such as seasonality and demographic variables to understand their influence on mortality rates.
- Provide insights into the significance of handwashing in healthcare and its implications for public health practices.

Tools and Technologies
- Python programming language
- Data manipulation and analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical analysis libraries (e.g., SciPy, StatsModels)

Project Structure
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the historical dataset and clean it for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and visualize the data to understand trends and patterns.
3. Mortality Rate Analysis: Calculate and compare mortality rates before and after handwashing.
4. Seasonality Analysis: Investigate seasonal variations in mortality rates and childbirth.
5. Statistical Testing: Conduct hypothesis testing to assess the significance of handwashing intervention.
6. Visualization and Insights: Present findings through visualizations and derive insights from the analysis.

Future Enhancements
- Incorporate modern epidemiological methods for a more comprehensive analysis.
- Explore additional historical datasets to compare handwashing practices across different time periods and regions.
- Develop educational resources to raise awareness about the importance of hand hygiene in healthcare settings.

Conclusion
"The Discovery of Handwashing â€“ A Python Recreation" project provides a retrospective analysis of the groundbreaking study by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis. By leveraging data analysis and visualization techniques, we aim to reaffirm the significance of handwashing in preventing infections and saving lives. This project underscores the importance of evidence-based practices in healthcare and serves as a reminder of the enduring impact of pioneering research.
